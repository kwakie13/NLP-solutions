# Natural Language Proccessing course solutions

It's not a project - it's just a repository with solutions for the Natural Language Processing course assignments. Throughout the course I had a chance to have my first experience with popular ML/NLP libraries such as spaCy, Vowpal Wabbit and scikit-learn.

In the above folders, you will find both assignemtns and their solutions. Enjoy! :)
